' Build process
Maven --> JAR : generates
Maven --> Target : outputs to

' User interactions
User --> Terminal : executes commands
Terminal --> JVM : java -jar legion.jar
User --> IDE : development (optional)
IDE --> Maven : build commands

' Version control
FS --> Git : commits/pushes
Git --> FS : clones/pulls

' Execution flow
Terminal --> MainApp : command line arguments
MainApp --> Terminal : console output

' Deployment notes
note right of JAR
    **Executable JAR contains:**
    • Main application classes
    • Unit implementations
    • Sorting algorithms
    • CLI parameter handling

    **Execution modes:**
    • Direct JAR execution
    • Maven exec plugin
    • IDE execution
end note

note left of Maven
    **Build artifacts:**
    • Compiled classes (target/classes)
    • Test classes (target/test-classes)
    • Packaged JAR (target/*.jar)

    **Dependencies:**
    • JUnit Jupiter (test scope)
    • Java 24 runtime
end note

note bottom of User
    **Usage examples:**
    java -jar legion.jar a=i u=2,1,1,1,3 t=c
    mvn exec:java "-Dexec.args=a=i u=1,1,1,1,1 t=n"
end note
